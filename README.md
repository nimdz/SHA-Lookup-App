## Overview

The SHA Reverse Lookup Tool is a web application that allows users to hash original inputs using SHA algorithms and look up their corresponding SHA hashes. Users can also view the stored entries in the database. This tool is built using Flask, a Python web framework, and uses SQLite for data storage.

## Features

- Hash original inputs using SHA algorithms.
- Lookup SHA hashes to find the original input.
- View all stored entries in the database.
- User-friendly interface with inline styling for better accessibility.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storing original inputs and their SHA hashes.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the web interface.
